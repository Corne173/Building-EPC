# Addressing overfitting and underfitting, Given the class imbalance in the EPC data

1. Data Augmentation and Resampling
Over-sampling minority classes: Use techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to create synthetic examples of the minority classes.
Under-sampling majority classes: Randomly under-sample the majority class to balance the dataset.
Combination of over-sampling and under-sampling: Use a hybrid approach to balance the dataset.
2. Regularization Techniques
L1/L2 Regularization: Add regularization terms to the loss function to penalize large weights.
Dropout: Randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training to prevent co-adaptation of features.
3. Cross-Validation
K-Fold Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data and to prevent overfitting.
Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation: Use stratified k-fold cross-validation to ensure each fold has the same proportion of each class as the original dataset.
4. Ensemble Methods
Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating): Train multiple models on different subsets of the data and average their predictions.
Boosting: Combine weak learners into a strong learner by focusing on the errors made by previous models.
5. Model Complexity
Simplify the model: Use a less complex model to avoid overfitting.
Hyperparameter tuning: Use grid search or random search to find the optimal hyperparameters for your model.
6. Early Stopping
Early Stopping: Monitor the model's performance on a validation set and stop training when performance starts to degrade.
7. Feature Engineering
Feature Selection: Remove irrelevant or redundant features to reduce the complexity of the model.
Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize features to improve convergence during training.
8. Data Split
Train-validation-test split: Ensure you have a proper split of your data into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.
